                    <p>
                        This project took place in my Data Mining and General Linear Models (STAT172) course at 
                        Drake University. WesleyLife was looking to expand their Meals on Wheels program to other
                        areas in Iowa. They tasked us to make reccomendations on different Public Use Microdata Areas
                        (PUMA's) in Iowa based on verious food insecurity measures.

                        Skills Used: R programming, Data cleaning/preparation, Machine learning based modeling (ridge, lasso, random-forest),
                        Data visualization (ggplot2), Github Repositories, Model Comparison, Presentations, Chloropleth Maps

                        This project took place in my Machine Learning courese at Drake University. The goal was to create a convolutional neural 
                        network that could classify different species of birds from images. The other goal was to compare different network and 
                        algorithm combinations to see which one was the most accurate. The networks used were AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet. The algorithms
                        used were SGD and Adam.

                        This project took place in my Machine Learning courese at Drake University. The goal was to create a machine learning Model
                        that could predict if a student would be admitted to a university based on a variety of different factors. We ran kNN, weighted-kNN,
                        decision-tree, and random forest models on normalized and non-normalized data. We then compared the models to see which one was the most accurate.
